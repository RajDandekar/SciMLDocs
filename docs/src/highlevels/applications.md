# A list of various domains and disciplines in which Julia's SciML tooling has been widely used.

## Epidemiology

Following are the epidemiological applications in which the SciML tooling has been used:

- Projecting hospital utilization during the COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States
- The Impact of Vaccination on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreaks in the United States 
- An examination of school reopening strategies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 
- The implications of silent transmission for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks
- Projecting demand for critical care beds during COVID-19 outbreaks in Canada 
- A Machine Learning-Aided Global Diagnostic and Comparative Tool to Assess Effect of Quarantine Control in COVID-19 Spread
- Implications of Delayed Reopening in Controlling the COVID-19 Surge in Southern and West-Central USA
- Safe Blues: The case for virtual safe virus spread in the long-term fight against epidemics
- Prioritising COVID-19 vaccination in changing social and epidemiological landscapes: a mathematical modelling study
